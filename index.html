        A croissant is <strong>crescent</strong> shaped roll made with
        yeast-risen dough. <br /><br />
        The dough is typically layered with butter, then rolled, and folded
        several times in a process called lamination. <br /><br />
        The final dough is cut into triangles and rolled into a crescent shape.
        The process of lamination results in a
        <em>layered, flaky textured roll</em>, more like puff pastry.
        <br /><br />
        The main ingredients in a croissant are <br />
        <strong>flour, yeast, salt, sugar, milk, water, eggs and butter</strong
        >. <br />
        <br />
        A well baked croissant should be flaky and crisp on the outside and
        tender and moist on the inside. It should be evenly baked and well
        aerated.<br /><br />
